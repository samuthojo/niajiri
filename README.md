niajiri is a Human Resource web platform, used to primarily reduce the hustle of screening process mostly Human Resource companies go through when they hire employees for other companies.

There will be three users namely Candidate (Job seeker), HR company (They are the Admins here) and A company in need of a employee, descriptions of what these users are going to do in a platform are documented on  a digest document attached below which we shared with our client,
